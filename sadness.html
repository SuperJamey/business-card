                <p>I feel like the biggest piece of shit. My struggle with quitting smoking</p>

                <p>and now I don't seem to give a shit about anything anymore. I have failed</p>
                <p>myself, the kidney transplant team, and the countless people who pray for</p>
                <p>me. I just feel like giving up.</p>
